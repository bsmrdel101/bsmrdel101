# About me

I absolutly love development and coding! I'm always working on some sort of project to improve my skills, and for fun.
Game development is also a hobby of mine and I frequently take part in game jams, using Unity and C#.

## Here's something I'm working on now

A virtual table top for Dungeons and Dragons, made with React, typescript, Node, Socket.io, PostgreSQL.
It's multiplayer and allows you to prepare and run a game of D&D with your friends.
