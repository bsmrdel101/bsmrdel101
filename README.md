# About me

I love coding! I'm always working on some sort of project to improve my skills, and for fun.
Game development is also a hobby of mine and I frequently take part in game jams.

## Here's something I'm working on

A virtual tabletop for Dungeons and Dragons made with React, TypeScript, Node, Socket.io, and PostgreSQL.
It's multiplayer and allows you to prepare and run a game of D&D with your friends.
